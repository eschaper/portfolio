Configuration setting is read from  Data/Config.txt
if you want to change the setting you must manually change the value on the second line, unless the value on the second line is an unsupported number.

Admin mode may not be fully completed, but when menu items are selected they should display how complete each item is.

The 'evil looping' issue should be mostly resolved. Entering the product and state information while editing and adding orders is still a little evil.

I tried to do as much user-proofing as possible, but I'm sure there are still areas unaccounted for. If you hit enter without typing anything enought times, you should always eventually return to the main menu.
